NOTE: This file is required for the docbuild on git to function properly on github!
The docbuild checks the contents of the ``doc/changelog/latest`` folder and fails if that folder
does not exist. However, git ignores empty folders.
This file, simply by existing, makes git acknowledge that ``doc/changelog/latest`` exists.
