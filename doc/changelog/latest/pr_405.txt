- Added :class:`~tenpy.algorithms.mps_common.QRBasedVariationalApplyMPO`.
- The following functions, which are used both by :class:`~tenpy.algorithms.tebd.QRBasedTEBDEngine`
  and by the new :class:`~tenpy.algorithms.mps_common.QRBasedVariationalApplyMPO` have been moved
  from :mod:`tenpy.algorithms.tebd` to :mod:`tenpy.algorithms.truncation`, have been changed
  substantially in parameters, behavior and return values;
  The old ``_qr_based_decomposition``, which is renamed to
  :func:`tenpy.algorithms.truncation.decompose_theta_qr_based`, as well as the private helper
  functions ``_qr_tebd_cbe_Y0`` and ``_eig_based_svd``.
