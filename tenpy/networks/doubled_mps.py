r"""This module contains an MPS class representing an density matrix by purification.

Usually, an MPS represents a pure state, i.e. the density matrix is :math:`\rho = |\psi><\psi|`,
describing observables as :math:`<O> = Tr(O|\psi><\psi|) = <\psi|O|\psi>`.
Clearly, if :math:`|\psi>` is the ground state of a Hamiltonian, this is the density matrix at
`T=0`.

At finite temperatures :math:`T > 0`, we want to describe a mixed density matrix
:math:`\rho = \exp(-H/T)`. The following approaches have been used to lift the power of tensor
network ansÃ¤tze (representing pure states= to finite temperatures (and mixed states in general).

1. Naively represent the density matrix as an MPO. This has the disadvantage that truncation can
   quickly lead to non-positive (and hence unphysical) density matrices.
2. Minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) as introduced in :cite:`white2009`.
3. Use Purification to represent the mixed density matrix by pure states in the doubled Hilbert
   space.
   In the literature, this is also referred to as matrix product density operators (MPDO) or
   locally purified density operator (LPDO).


Here, we follow the third approach.
In addition to the physical space `P`, we introduce a second 'auxiliar' space `Q`
and define the density matrix
of the physical system as :math:`\rho = Tr_Q(|\phi><\phi|)`, where :math:`|\phi>` is a pure state
in the combined physical and auxiliary system.

For :math:`T=\infty`, the density matrix :math:`\rho_\infty` is the identity matrix.
In other words, expectation values are sums over all possible states
:math:`<O> = Tr_P(\rho_\infty O) = Tr_P(O)`.
Saying that each ``:`` on top is to be connected with the corresponding ``:`` on the bottom,
the trace is simply a contraction::

    |         :   :   :   :   :   :
    |         |   |   |   |   |   |
    |         |-------------------|
    |         |        O          |
    |         |-------------------|
    |         |   |   |   |   |   |
    |         :   :   :   :   :   :

Clearly, we get the same result, if we insert an identity operator, written as MPO, on the top
and bottom::

    |         :   :   :   :   :   :
    |         |   |   |   |   |   |
    |         B---B---B---B---B---B
    |         |   |   |   |   |   |
    |         |-------------------|
    |         |        O          |
    |         |-------------------|
    |         |   |   |   |   |   |
    |         B*--B*--B*--B*--B*--B*
    |         |   |   |   |   |   |
    |         :   :   :   :   :   :

We  use the following label convention::

    |         q
    |         ^
    |         |
    |  vL ->- B ->- vR
    |         |
    |         ^
    |         p

You can view the `MPO` as an MPS by combining the `p` and `q` leg and defining every physical
operator to act trivial on the `q` leg. In expectation values, you would then sum over
over the `q` legs, which is exactly what we need.
In other words, the choice :math:`B = \delta_{p,q}` with trivial (length-1) virtual bonds yields
infinite temperature expectation values for operators action only on the `p` legs!

Now, you go a step further and also apply imaginary time evolution (acting only on `p` legs)
to the initial infinite temperature state.
For example, the normalized state :math:`|\psi> \propto \exp(-\beta/2 H)|\phi>`
yields expectation values

.. math ::
    <O>  = Tr(\exp(-\beta H) O) / Tr(\exp(-\beta H))
    \propto <\phi|\exp(-\beta/2 H) O \exp(-\beta/2 H)|\phi>.

An additional real-time evolution allows to calculate time correlation functions:

.. math ::
    <A(t)B(0)> \propto <\phi|\exp(-\beta H/2) \exp(+i H t) A \exp(-i H t) B \exp(-\beta H/2) |\phi>

Time evolution algorithms (TEBD and MPO application) are adjusted in the module
:mod:`~tenpy.algorithms.purification`.

See also :cite:`karrasch2013` for additional tricks! One of their crucial observations is, that
one can apply arbitrary unitaries on the auxiliar space (i.e. the `q`) without changing the result.
This can actually be used to reduce the necessary virtual bond dimensions:
From the definition, it is easy to see that if we apply :math:`exp(-i H t)` to the `p` legs of
:math:`|\phi>`, and :math:`\exp(+iHt)` to the `q` legs, they just cancel out!
(They commute with :math:`\exp(-\beta H/2)`...)
If the state is modified (e.g. by applying `A` or `B` to calculate correlation functions),
this is not true any more. However, we still can find unitaries, which are 'optimal' in the sense
of reducing the entanglement of the MPS/MPO to the minimal value.
For a discussion of `Disentanglers` (implemented in :mod:`~tenpy.algorithms.disentanglers`),
see :cite:`hauschild2018`.

.. note ::
    The classes :class:`~tenpy.linalg.networks.mps.MPSEnvironment` and
    :class:`~tenpy.linalg.networks.mps.TransferMatrix` should also work for the
    :class:`PurificationMPS` defined here.
    For example, you can use :meth:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPSEnvironment.expectation_value`
    for the expectation value of operators between different PurificationMPS.
    However, this makes only sense if the *same* disentangler was applied
    to the `bra` and `ket` PurificationMPS.

.. note ::
    The literature (e.g. section 7.2 of :cite:`schollwoeck2011` or :cite:`karrasch2013`) suggests
    to use a `singlet` as a maximally entangled state.
    Here, we use instead the identity :math:`\delta_{p,q}`, since it is easier to
    generalize for `p` running over more than two indices, and allows a simple use of charge
    conservation with the above `qconj` convention.
    Moreover, we don't split the physical and auxiliar space into separate sites, which makes
    TEBD as costly as :math:`O(d^6 \chi^3)`.

    Entanglement entropy for density matrices (or operators) is weird, since we don't need two copies

    So given some region A, what we are calculating is something like $-Tr((\rho^2)_A \ln (\rho^2)_A)$,

    MPS with local Hilbert space d**2 rather than having two physical legs of dimension d) and tracing 
    over the complement of A (A-bar). So then we are left with a density matrix of region $A$ that has
    4 |A| legs (2 bras, 2 kets). We then project this into the bond space using the isometry tensors of
    \rho, which gets us back to an RDM just defined by the singular values on the bond (assuming that we
